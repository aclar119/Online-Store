                <p>In February 2020, five college friends from Ottawa came together with a common passion 
                    for sustainability and ethics. They were frustrated by the lack of options for consumers   
                    looking to buy products that align with their values. Despite the growing awareness of 
                    environmental issues, they found it difficult to find brands that prioritize sustainability 
                    and ethical production methods. The market was dominated by fast-fashion brands with 
                    questionable practices, and the friends were determined to create a better alternative. 
                   <br> Driven by their shared values and concern for the environment, they decided to create 
                    their own ecological and ethical brand. With backgrounds in design, marketing, and 
                    environmental science, the friends utilized their diverse skill sets to create a brand that 
                    not only looked good but also did good.
