                <p>In February 2020, five college friends from Ottawa came together with a common passion 
                    for sustainability and ethics. They were frustrated by the lack of options for consumers   
                    looking to buy products that align with their values. Despite the growing awareness of 
                    environmental issues, they found it difficult to find brands that prioritize sustainability 
                    and ethical production methods. The market was dominated by fast-fashion brands with 
                    questionable practices, and the friends were determined to create a better alternative. 
                   <br> Driven by their shared values and concern for the environment, they decided to create 
                    their own ecological and ethical brand. With backgrounds in design, marketing, and 
                    environmental science, the friends utilized their diverse skill sets to create a brand that 
                    not only looked good but also did good. They source materials locally and use eco-friendly 
                    production methods to minimize their carbon footprint. The brand quickly gained a 
                    following among socially and environmentally conscious consumers, and the friends have 
                    since expanded their reach, opening several storefronts in and around Ottawa. Despite 
                    their success, they remain dedicated to their mission of promoting sustainability and 
                    creating products that make a positive impact on the world...

                <h2 class="h-nature">2019| The birth of Generic Clothing co.</h2>
                <p>Our story began in 1812 when Peter Simons arrived from
                    Scotland and settled on a small farm near Quebec City to raise
                     his family of five. In 1840 his son John moved into the city to
                    open a small shop, where he sold dry goods and various
                    imported wares. To make sure his business received the latest
                    in goods from Europe, he made over 70 Atlantic crossings by
                    sailing ship. In those early days, John Simons was already
                    putting an emphasis on quality merchandise and attentive
                    service, setting the stage for the future success of La Maison
                    Simons.</p>
