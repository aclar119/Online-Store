                <h2>2019| The birth of Generic Clothing co.</h2>
                <p>Our story began in 1812 when Peter Simons arrived from
                    Scotland and settled on a small farm near Quebec City to raise
                     his family of five. In 1840 his son John moved into the city to
                    open a small shop, where he sold dry goods and various
                    imported wares. To make sure his business received the latest
                    in goods from Europe, he made over 70 Atlantic crossings by
                    sailing ship. In those early days, John Simons was already
                    putting an emphasis on quality merchandise and attentive
                    service, setting the stage for the future success of La Maison
                    Simons.</p>
